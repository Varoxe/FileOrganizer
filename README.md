<h1>Downloads Organizer</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

This Python script automatically organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into designated folders based on their file extensions. It categorizes various file types such as images, videos, documents, programs, music, and compressed files into corresponding folders.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Python 3.x
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

<h2>Installation</h2>
No installation is necessary for the script itself. Python 3 should be installed on your system.

<h2>How to Use:</h2>

1. The script is preset to organize the Downloads folder in your user profile.
2. Customize the file_mappings dictionary in the script to match your preferred organization structure.

<h2>Running the Script:</h2>

Execute the script in a Python environment where you have the necessary permissions to create folders and move files. The script automatically creates the required subfolders and moves files into them based on their extensions.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

- If certain files are not moved, check if their extensions are correctly listed in the file_mappings dictionary.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in the Downloads folder for creating subfolders and moving files.
- If the script indicates that a file already exists in the target folder, consider renaming or manually moving the file.
