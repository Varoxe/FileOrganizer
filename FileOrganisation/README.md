<h1>File Organizer</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

This script is designed to help organize files in a download folder on a Windows system. It automatically sorts files into designated folders based on their file extensions.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Python 3.x
Windows operating system (the script uses Windows-style file paths)
Installation
No installation is necessary for the script itself. Simply ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.

<h2>To use this script, follow these steps</h2>

Update the source_directory variable in the script to point to the directory you want to organize.

Customize the file_mappings dictionary in the script to fit the types of files you want to organize and how you want them organized.

<h2>Run the script using Python</h2>

Make sure to run the script in a Python environment where you have the necessary permissions to create folders and move files.

The script will create folders if they don't exist and move files into these folders based on the file extension.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If files are not being moved, ensure you have the correct file extensions listed in file_mappings. Additionally, check for permissions issues in the target directory.
